# Snippets

In Konsist all checks are tailored for a given project.&#x20;

As the project grows additional checks can be defined to enforce various checks eg. layer boundaries, package structure, class naming, and more. The following sections contain a set of sample checks to give an idea of what is achievable with Konsist.

Most of the snippets are wrapped as [JUnit](https://junit.org/) tests, however, these snippets can be easily wrapped in the [kotest](https://kotest.io/) tests.
