# Compatibility

The `Java 8` is a minimum [Java](https://www.java.com/en) version required to run Konsist.

Konsist is compatible with all types of Kotlin projects including [Android](https://www.android.com/), [Spring](https://spring.io/), and [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) projects.

Konsist works with a popular test framework that executes Kotlin code, however, is it recommended to use [JUni4](https://junit.org/junit4/) or [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/).&#x20;

Konsist is compatible with popular build systems such as [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
