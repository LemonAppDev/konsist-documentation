# Project Status

The Konsist linter has undergone extensive field testing across a variety of projects, including  [Spring](https://spring.io/), [Android](https://www.android.com/), and [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html), and is compatible with both [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build systems. Additionally, Konsist features a comprehensive test suite with around 5,000 tests, running on various operating systems including MacOS, Windows, and Ubuntu, to minimize the risk of regressions.

Konsist is safe for use because it is not bundled with the production code (only included in the test source sets).
