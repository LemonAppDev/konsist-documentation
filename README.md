# What is Konsist?

![](.gitbook/assets/konsist-logo.png)

Konsist is a static code analyzer for the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language. It supports a variety of Kotlin-based projects including [Android](https://www.android.com/), [Spring](https://spring.io/), and [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) projects.

Konsist simplifies the process of maintaining codebase consistency by upholding coding conventions and safeguarding the project's architecture. It empowers developers to create consistency checks through unit tests, which can be run during pull request (PR) reviews for verification.

Konsist is in the early stage of development. See the [project-status.md](getting-started/project-status.md "mention").

Konsist offers two categories of checks, namely declaration checks and architecture checks, to thoroughly evaluate the codebase.

## Declaration Checks

The first type involves declaration checks, where custom tests are created to identify common issues and violations at the declaration level (classes, functions, properties, etc.). These cover various aspects such as class naming, package structure, visibility modifiers, presence of annotations, etc. Here are a few ideas of things to check:

* Every child class extending `ViewModel` must have `ViewModel` suffix
* Classes with the `@Repository` annotation should reside in `..repository..` package
* Every class constructor has alphabetically ordered parameters
* Every constructor parameter has a name derived from the class name
* Field injection and `m` prefix is forbidden
* Every public member in `api` package must be documented with kDoc
* and more...

Here is a sample test that verifies if every use case class resides in `domain.usecase` package:

```kotlin
@Test
fun `every use case reside in use case package`() {
    Konsist
        .scopeFromProject() // Define the scope containing all Kotlin files present in the project
        .classes() // Get all class declarations
        .withNameEndingWith("UseCase") // Filter classes heaving name ending with 'UseCase'
        .assert { it.resideInPackage("..domain.usecase..") } // Assert that each class resides in 'any domain.usecase any' package
}
```

For more Konsist test samples see the [snippets](inspiration/snippets/ "mention")section.
{% endhint %}

## Architecture Checks

The second type of Konsit checks revolves around architecture boundaries -  they are intended to maintain the separation of concerns between layers eg:

* The `domain` layer is independent
* The `data` layer depends on `domain` layer
* The `presentation` layer depends on `domain` layer
* etc.

{% hint style="info" %}
These types of checks are useful when the architecture layer is defined by the package, rather than a module where dependencies can be enforced by the build system.

Here is a sample test that verifies if [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) dependency requirements are valid:

```kotlin
@Test
fun `clean architecture layers have correct dependencies`() {
    Konsist
        .scopeFromProject() // Define the scope containing all Kotlin files present in project
        .assertArchitecture { // Assert architecture
            // Define layers
            val domain = Layer("Domain", "com.myapp.domain..")
            val presentation = Layer("Presentation", "com.myapp.presentation..")
            val data = Layer("Data", "com.myapp.data..")

            // Define architecture assertions
            domain.dependsOnNothing()
            presentation.dependsOn(domain)
            data.dependsOn(domain)
        }
} 
```
