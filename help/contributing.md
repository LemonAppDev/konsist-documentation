## Contributing

So you want to help? That's great!

{% hint style="info" %}
To chat with Konsist developers and the Konsist community please check the [#konsist channel](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C05QG9FD6KS) at `kotlinlang` Slack workspace (preferred), or start a new [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist/discussions).
{% endhint %}

The Konsist project is now at a critical stage where community input is essential to polish and mature it.

{% hint style="info" %}
This contributing guide is still to be polished, so feel free to [start a new discussion or open an issue](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist/discussions/new/choose) to discuss contributions, features/fixes, and implementation details.
{% endhint %}

There are a variety of ways to contribute to the Konsist project:

* **Coding:** This is the most common way to contribute. You can fix bugs or add new features.
* **Testing:** You can help to improve the quality by testing the code and reporting bugs. This is a great way to get involved and help out maturing the project.
* **Documentation:** You can help to improve the documentation by writing or editing documentation. This is a great way to help people understand how to use Konsist.
* **Community:** You can answer questions or participate in discussions. This is a great way to connect with other programmers.
* **Spread the word:** You can help to spread the word about the Konsist by talking about it with fellow developers. You can also write a short post or a full-fledged article.

No matter how you choose to contribute, you will be making a valuable contribution to the open-source community.

## Communication

The best way to interact with the Konsist team is the dedicated [#konsist-dev](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C0628CK7TEV) channel at `kotlinlang` Slack workspace.

## Tickets

Our [contributor backlog is public](https://lemonappdev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20ContributeOpportunity%20and%20status%20in%20%28Open%2C%20%22Board%20Backlog%22%2C%20Backlog%29%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC) in JIRA. If you want to join say hello at  [#konsist-dev](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C0628CK7TEV) Slack channel. If you are working on a ticket make sure to get the JIRA access, assign it to yourself, and update the ticket status to In Progress).

Tickets that can be grabbed by the community have a `ContributeOpportunity` label. These are mostly tickets that are not blocking our work. You can also work on another ticket, but this will require more alignment with me, for example, certain features and planed ahead, so the ticket should be completed within a given time period.

## Repositories

Konsist project is spread across multiple repositories:

* [konsist](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist) - repository containing Konist code
* k[onsist-documentation](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist-documentation) - repository containing Konsist documentation (this webpage)

## IntelliJ IDEA Plugins

Some of the project readmes contain [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams. For a diagram preview, it is recommended to install the [Mermaid plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20146-mermaid/reviews).

## Make A Change In The Konsist Repository

This is a high-level view of project contribution:

1\. Create a fork of the [Konsist](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist) repository

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2\. Uncheck "Copy the main branch only".

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3\. Build the project

4\. Open the project using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

5\. Create a new branch from the `develop` branch

6\. Implement changes

7\. Add Tests

{% hint style="warning" %}
Konsist adheres to stringent testing standards. Each Provider undergoes testing against every type of declaration, leading to an extensive set of tests. This thorough testing ensures two main objectives:

1. Guaranteeing future compatibility with Kotlin 2.0.
2. Due to reliance on an external library for parsing, it's imperative to have comprehensive tests to ensure the Konsist API functions as anticipated.
{% endhint %}

8\. Open the `Draft` Pull Request to the `develop` branch (`develop` will be merged into the `main` branch after the release)

9\. Make sure all checks are passing before marking PR as `Ready for review`.

{% hint style="info" %}
For some contributors, the repo admin may have to approve checks manually for the 1st PR.
{% endhint %}

### No Matching Toolchains Found Error

If during a build you encounter an error regarding `No matching toolchains found` then open `Module Settings` / `Project Structure` windows and set Java SDK to version `19`.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can install missing JDKs directly from IntelliJ IDEA - click on the `Module SDK` combo box and select `+Add SDK`.

If during the build you encounter an error regarding `Could not determine the dependencies of null.` then open `File` / `Settings` / `Build, Execute, Deployment` / `Build Tools` / `Gradle` window and set Java SDK to version `19`.

### Testing Changes Locally

#### Publish Local Konsist Artefact

To test the changes locally you can publish a `SNAPSHOT` artifact of the Konsist to the local maven repository:

```bash
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -Pkonsist.releaseTarget=local
```

After publishing a new artifact `x.y.z-SNAPSHOT` with the version number will appear in the local Maven repository:

```
Mac: /Users/<user_name>/.m2/repository/com/lemonappdev/konsist
Windows: C:\Users\<User_Name>\.m2\repository\com\lemonappdev\konsist
Linux: /home/<User_Name>/.m2/repository/com/lemonappdev/konsist
```

The actual Konsist version is defined in the [gradle.properties](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist/blob/main/gradle.properties) file. The `SNAPSHOT` suffix will be added automatically to the published artifact.

To use this artifact you have to add a local Maven repository to your project.

#### Use Published Artifact From Local Maven Repository

Every project contains a list of the repositories used to retrieve the dependencies. A local Maven repository has to be manually added to the project.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
Add the following block to the `build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenLocal()
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Maven" %}
By default, the Maven project uses a local repository. If not add the following block to the `module\pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>local</id>
        <url>file://${user.home}/.m2/repository</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="More" %}
Dependency can be added to other build systems as well. Check the [snippets](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.lemonappdev/konsist) section in the sonatype repository.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Now build scripts will use the local repository to resolve dependencies, however, the version of Konsist has to be updated to the `SNAPSHOT` version of the newly published artifact e.g.

`com.lemonappdev:konsist:0.12.0-SNAPSHOT`

Now build scripts will be able to resolve this newly published Konsist artifact.

#### Verify Used Konsist Artifact Version

IntelliJ IDEA UI provides a convenient way to check which version of Konsist is used by the project. Open the `External Libraries` section of `Project view` and search for Konsist dependency:

### Checks

During the PR review, several types of checks are executed using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) ([.github/workflow](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist/tree/main/.github/workflows)). These checks can also be executed locally using the following commands:

* [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) (runs [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint))
  * `./gradlew spotlessCheck` - check the code using Spotless
  * `./gradlew spotlessApply` - check and fix code using Spotless (if possible)
* [Detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt)
  * `./gradlew detektCheck` - check the code using Detekt
  * `./gradlew detektApply` - check and fix code using Detekt (if possible)
* Tests
  * `./gradlew lib:test` - run JUnit tests
  * `./gradlew lib:apiTest` - run API tests
  * `./gradlew lib:integrationTest` - run integrations tests
  * `./gradlew lib:konsistTest` - run Konsist tests to test Konsist codebase ðŸ¤¯ðŸ˜‰

### Source Sets

Konsist contains multiple custom source sets (defined by the [JVM Test Suite Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jvm\_test\_suite\_plugin.html)) to provide better isolation between various types of tests:

* `test` - tests related to generic Konsist API (everything except the `architectureAssert`)
* `apiTest` - tests related to `architectureAssert`
* `integrationTest` - test classes using custom Kotlin snippets (`.kttxt`) to test the Konsist API
* `konsistTest` - tests Konsist codebase consistency using `konsist` library
* `snippets` - contains Kotlin code snippets, written as methods (tests without `@Test` annotation), so the tests are not executed. These snippets are used to generate documentation. The update-snippets.py script generates PR to update the [snippets](https://docs.konsist.lemonappdev.com/inspiration/snippets) page

We aim to test the majority of aspects within these source sets. However, certain kinds of checks require a dedicated test project. These projects are available in the [test-project](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist/tree/main/test-projects) directory on the Konsist repository.

### Layers

        Api --> Core
    end
    Client --> Konsist
```

### Make a Change In The Konsist Documentation Repository

The [konsist-documentation](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist-documentation) repository contains this website. Create a fork of the repository, make changes using any text editor (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), and open the Pull Request targeting the `main` branch.

#### Updating Snippets

The [snippets](../inspiration/snippets/ "mention")section requires a different approach. To ensure the snippets remain valid and aligned with Konsist API, we store them within the [snippet source set](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist/tree/main/lib/src/snippet/kotlin) of the [konsist](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist) repository. With every release, new snippet pages are generated from the [snippet source set](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist/tree/main/lib/src/snippet/kotlin) and placed in the GitBook documentation ([konsist-documentation](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist-documentation) repository).

Some snippets depend on classes/interfaces/annotations from external frameworks such as Spring `Repository` annotation or Android `ViewModel` class. To avoid coupling Konsist with these frameworks and allow snippet compilation, we store placeholder classes mimicking the full names of the external framework in [this directory](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist/tree/main/lib/src/snippet/kotlin). class e.g. [Inject.kt](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist/blob/main/lib/src/snippet/kotlin/javax/inject/Inject.kt).

## Articles

We already have multiple community-written articles. Why not write another one? make sure to let us know if you do.

## Asserts And Logos

The Konsist logo can be found in the [misc folder](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist/tree/main/misc/konsist-logo) of the main repository.
